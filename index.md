## IT Consultant | creator of Scrum.wiki

I am an IT Consultant specializing in Agile project management. I help organizations manage their IT projects, develop IT products, and run teams efficiently using Agile methodologies.

### Expertise
- Managing IT projects and developing IT products.
- Implementing Agile practices to enhance team efficiency and maximize value.
- Supporting organizations whether they are committed to Scrum or still exploring Agile methodologies.

### Approach:### 
My approach is centered around people. I focus on understanding the motivations of each individual and the value they bring to the organization. Establishing processes that align with the company culture is crucial, as technology choices become secondary once these processes are in place.

As someone with a background in mathematics, I am analytical and detail-oriented. I prioritize understanding all relevant information thoroughly and filtering out what is unnecessary. This allows me to gain a deep understanding of both the managerial and technical aspects of projects.

### Why Scrum?### 
I appreciate Scrum because it fosters autonomy, builds trust within the organization, and maximizes value while creating a reliable work environment. This is why I created [Scrum.wiki](https://scrum.wiki) to further promote and explain these principles.

### Experience:### 
I have extensive experience in IT transformation projects, including introducing Agile practices, test management, change management, and process analysis and optimization. My industry experience spans Insurance and Automotive sectors, and I have worked with large international organizations. I am certified by Scrum.org and PRINCE2.
