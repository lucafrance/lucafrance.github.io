I am an IT consultant based in Munich with experience in management and technical roles.
The main value I can provide is a holistic understanding of the management, technical, and human side of your business.
I speak German, English, and Italian fluently and have experience in both local and international settings.

## Agile Project Management

I am familiar with Agile project management.
My experience includes the transformation from waterfall to Agile frameworks.
I can use Agile tools like Azure Devops, Jira, and Confluence.

## Data

I understand and can support various steps of the data value chain:
- Collecting data, e.g. with [web scraping](https://github.com/lucafrance/cia-factbook-scraper) or [over APIs](https://github.com/lucafrance/bike-traffic-munich).
- Writing SQL queries and stored procedures.
- Defining KPIs and automating project reports.
- Understanding and applying complex quantitative methods.

I am a curios constant self learner for several topics, including [machine learning]({% post_url 2021-04-05-mnist-pairwise-one-pixel %}).
