# About me
<img src="/assets/2022/cv/cv_pic_luca_franceschini.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:10px" width="180">
I am a senior consultant based in Munich with six years of experience in IT projects. 
The main value I can provide to you is a holistic understanding of the management, technical, and human side of your business.
I speak German, English, and Italian fluently and have experience in both local and international settings.
See my CV in [English](/assets/2022/cv/cv_en_Luca_Franceschini.pdf) or [German](/assets/2022/cv/cv_de_Luca_Franceschini.pdf).

## Scripting
I automate tasks so you don't have to perform them. The tools I use include [VBA](/tags#VBA), [Python](/tags#Python), and Power Automate.

## Data
I extract meaning from data to enable you to make informed decisions. I have experience with business analysis, data mining, and [machine learning](/tags#Machine learning).
The tools I use include Excel, Power Query, and several Python libraries (`pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).

## Excel Training
I can teach you Excel skills both at an introductory and at an advanced level. A focus on specific topics is available upon request.
