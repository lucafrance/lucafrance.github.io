# About me

<img src="/assets/2022/cv/cv_pic_luca_franceschini.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:10px" width="180">
I am an IT professional based in Munich. 
The main value I can provide to you is a holistic understanding of the management, technical, and human side of your business.
I speak German, English, and Italian fluently and have experience in both local and international settings.

## Scripting

I automate tasks so you don't have to perform them. The tools I use include [VBA](/tags#VBA), [Python](/tags#Python), and Power Automate.

## Data

I extract meaning from data to enable you to make informed decisions. I have experience with business analysis, data mining, and [machine learning](/tags#Machine learning).
The tools I use include Excel, Power Query, and several Python libraries (`pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).

## Excel Training

I teach Excel in Munich [at the MVHS](https://www.mvhs.de/services/dozierendenportraets/dozent-14168) and privately on request. 
See an example of what I offer in [German](http://lucaf.eu/excel/de/) or [English](http://lucaf.eu/excel/en/).
