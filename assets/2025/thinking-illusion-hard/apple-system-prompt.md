You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg. The disks are numbered from *1* (smallest) to *n* (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg. Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is \[\[3, 2, 1\], \[\], \[\]\], and a solution might be:
```
moves = [[1 , 0 , 2] , [2 , 0 , 1] , [1 , 2 , 1] ,
         [3 , 0 , 2] , [1 , 1 , 0] , [2 , 1 , 2] , [1 , 0 , 2]]
```

This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on. **Requirements**: 
- When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves. 
- The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0). 
- Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format:
- `moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]`
