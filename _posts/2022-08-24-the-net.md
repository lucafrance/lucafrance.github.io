TL, DR: üñ±Ô∏èüçïü§ì

I recently saw *The Net*, a 1995 thriller starring a 30 year old Sandra Bullock.
It is enjoyable, as long as you don't question the baddies' actions.
If not, you will spend most of the movie wondering "Wait, why did they not just...?".

The main enjoyment is seeing how the internet was depicted in a time where it was starting to become a thing.
The movie is not exiting, but it is charming in reminding us how we live metaphorically and literally in *the future*.

**SPOILER ALERT**

Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett, a introvert hacker living in Venice, California.
She is doing marvelous things with technology, like:
- working remotely,
- ordering a pizza online,
- chatting with people online.

It is funny how the movie focuses on Angela's futuristic actions.
She is ordering pizza with extra garlic and anchovies *on a computer*, wow.

Annette is depicted a solitary persons, her only human contact in real life being with her mother.
Despite this, she appears a to be a functional member of society, ready to go on vacations.

This is the where you should turn off your brain.
The handsome Jeremy (Jack Devlin) is another hacker.
Who happens to be on the exact same beach as Angela.
While she is opens her laptop.
In 1995.

Obviously he is a baddy, a bad one.
He want to retrieve a floppy from Angela's purse.
Instead of just stealing the purse, he is going to have dinner with Angela, seduce her, let another guy steal the purse, run after the guy, kill the guy, go back to Angela, take her on a boat, get laid, grab wine, then try (and fail) to kill her.
