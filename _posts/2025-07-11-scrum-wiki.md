I am happy to announce a new website: [scrum.wiki](http://scrum.wiki/)!

While preparing for the PRINCE2 Foundation certification, I found [prince2.wiki](https://prince2.wiki/) very helpful.
Since I could not find a comparable resource for Scrum, I built  one myself.

In the spirit of Scrumâ€™s collaborative nature, the wiki is released under the same license as the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html): [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The site was created using Obsidian.
If you're curious or want to contribute, the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucafrance/scrum.wiki-vault).

I hope this resource supports many people, whether they're new to Scrum or seasoned in its practice.
