I am happy to announce that [Nexus](https://scrum.wiki/Nexus) is now also on [scrum.wiki](https://scrum.wiki).

Nexus is a framework for Scrum with multiple teams developed by [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org) and [Ken Schwaber](https://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/).
I like Nexus because:
- It is still Scrum with its values intact.
- The structure is just enough to ensure increments are valuable and integrated effectively.
- The framework stays lightweight and adaptable to the needs of the organization.

Adding Nexus is a natural evolution for [scrum.wiki](https://scrum.wiki) and I hope it will be useful to many people.
