title: How to enable the <code>Print Screen</code> key on a Logitech keyboard
tags: []

I recently got a [Logitech K650 keyboard](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/5124495316631-Getting-Started-SIGNATURE-K650) which I mostly enjoy, except for the [`print screen`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_Screen) key being replaced by `Ctrt + P`.
While this non-standard choice might make sense for most people, for me meant not being able to [take screenshots](https://getgreenshot.org/) any more.
Here is how I avoided changing the shortcuts I have been using for years.

Download and install [Logi Options+](https://support.logi.com/hc/it/articles/4418699283607).
Your keyboard should be shown automatically, click on it.

Click on the `print` key.

Open Windows's [On-Screen Keyboard](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ecbb5e08-5b4e-d8c8-f794-81dbf896267a).
Use the On-Screen Keyboard to enter `print screen` as a shortcut.

You can close Logi Options+, your print key is now working as it should.
