Tl, DR: ü§®üò†üìïüóëÔ∏è

Book contains some good ideas, the recommendations to implement them are bad. 
The book is about how to overcome obstacles by embracing them. 

These are the kind of suggestions which are easy to phrase, but difficult to set in practice.
The value in the book would be in how to grow the mindset to act on the suggestions.
The strategy of the author is a common one in business book.
Provide lots of cherry picked examples from famous people in history (mostly white men) and twist their story to fit their message.
This is not useful, as you might feel inspired in the moment, but can't related that kind of experience in an ordinary life.
If you take the "inspiring" examples away, most of the book can be summarized in just a few lines.   
1. Try to see obstacles as opportunities.
Alter your perception to stay in control of your emotion and focus on what you can do.
(61 pages)
2. Embrace failure. (62 pages)
3. Develop will power. (57 pages)

These suggestions require discipline.
Acquiring the discipline is the difficult part, the book does't help with it.


Examples are supposed to help.
Just believe and stuck to it is not good advice.
How do you go from "I understand the concept" to "I develop the mindset to act on it".


Examples are not good and not relatable.

Book is not actionable.

the author made another book, *Trust me, I'm lying*. That one is good.
