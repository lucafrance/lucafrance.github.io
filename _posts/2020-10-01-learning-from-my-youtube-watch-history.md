I like YouTube. A lot. It is a great tool to learn new skills and enjoy diverse culture from the whole world. What I don't like is YouTube's algorithm constatly trying to grab my attention to sell it to advertisers. I feel too often trapped in pressing the next recommended video not even realizing what I am doing. As feelings are not always useful to understand myself, I decided to analyse the YouTube watch history to understand my usage with data.
