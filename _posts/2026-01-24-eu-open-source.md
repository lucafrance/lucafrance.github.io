[Ploum (Lionel Dricot)](https://ploum.net) makes [a good case](https://ploum.net/2026-01-22-why-no-european-google.html) for pushing open source culture in Europe.

I see open source as a necessary cultural tool in building Europe's technological sovereignty.
You don't fix the over-dependence on tech giants by creating new tech giants to depend on.

Free citizens and institutions depend on the freedom to choose the digital tools they prefer.
An open source software tech stack reduces the reliance on centralised solutions; which enables more people to benefit from it.
