TL, DR: If Johnny Decimal didn't work for you, try [my approach](link to spec on GitHub).

I struggled for a long time with a structure of my digital files.
I regularly moved stuff around and was never able to keep it consistent.
I while back I discovered [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) by Johnny Noble.
It is inspired from the [Dewey decimal classification](https://www.britannica.com/science/Dewey-Decimal-Classification) for libraries and applies a similar logic to folder structure.

```
- 10-10 Finance
    - 11 Tax returns
    - 12 Payroll
        - 12.01 Staff bank details for payments
        - 12.02 Payroll calculation spreadsheet
        - 12.03 Payroll schedule for 2018
    - 13 Bookkeping
-20-29 Administration
    - 21 Company registration
    - 22 Contracts
    - 23 Staffing
- 30-39 Marketing
    - 31 Assets
    - 32 Campaigns
    - 33 Publicity
    - 34 Events
- 40-49 Sales
    - 41 Sales figures
    - 42 Proposal
```
*Example from [johnnydecimal.com](https://johnnydecimal.com/)*

didn't like that stuff that is completed stays in the way 

useful for groups for shared structure, not my thing

many different things in my head/life, not single project

want possibility to add stuff without thinking

Johnny decimal assumes that you can identify a stable structure.
This is not my case, I regularly finish and start working on new stuff.
Johnny Decimal was starting to stand in the way of my mind.
For me it was more important to be able to get stuff in and out the system easily, which is difficult if I try to fit it in a previous structure of my mind, which was different and had different priorities.

Johnny includes the reccomendation of reproducing structure for each project, but that kinda defeats purpose

10 folders limiting



I learned about PARA

like focus on action

> PARA isn’t a filing system ; it’s a production system .


Combined best of both for me
