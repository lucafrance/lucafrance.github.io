TL, DR: If Johnny Decimal didn't work for you, try [my approach](link to spec on GitHub).

*Note: this is not an introduction to Johnny Decimal or PARA, it is a personal experience on how i applied the systems.*

I struggled for a long time with a structure of my digital files.
I regularly moved stuff around and was never able to keep it consistent.
I while back I discovered [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) by Johnny Noble.
It is inspired from the [Dewey decimal classification](https://www.britannica.com/science/Dewey-Decimal-Classification) for libraries and applies a similar logic to folder structure.

```
- 10-10 Finance
    - 11 Tax returns
    - 12 Payroll
        - 12.01 Staff bank details for payments
        - 12.02 Payroll calculation spreadsheet
        - 12.03 Payroll schedule for 2018
    - 13 Bookkeping
-20-29 Administration
    - 21 Company registration
    - 22 Contracts
    - 23 Staffing
- 30-39 Marketing
    - 31 Assets
    - 32 Campaigns
    - 33 Publicity
    - 34 Events
- 40-49 Sales
    - 41 Sales figures
    - 42 Proposal

## What i like and don't like about Johnny Decimal

In Johnny decimal I like most the decision to use at most two levels of subfolders:
- 10 *areas*,
- 10 *categories* per *area*,
- up to 100 *unique things* per *category*.

Such restriction prevents rabbit holes of folders difficult to navigate.
The 10 > 10 > 100 structure is flexible, while forcing to think about the organization and matching it.

I like that the numbering of the folders gives an indication of the position within the general structure: `xy` is the first level, `xy.ab` is the second level.

I didn't try Johnny Decimal in teams yet, but I believe it is great for teams working on processes that change little over time.
What Johnny Decimal didn't fit any more is for an individual like me that enjoys embracing anarchy once in a while.
The Johnny Decimal structure I defined improved my previous anarchic system, but started struggling soon for three reasons.

1. I regularly start new projects, which might often be experiments going nowhere but I want to do them anyway.
Having to fit these projects in a structure which didn't conceive their existence was adding unnecessary mental burden.

1. There is not an obvious way to archive older files.
If I have a project in `10.01 Project A`, then it will stay there on top of my list even when the project is over.
There are workarounds, but they involve braking up the decimal structure, which must be kept consistent manually among all apps.

1. i realized afterwards that some stuff in the structure got more prominence than it deserves, or vice versa.



didn't like that stuff that is completed stays in the way 

didn't like that it is difficult to enter new stuff

useful for groups for shared structure, not my thing

many different things in my head/life, not single project

want possibility to add stuff without thinking

Johnny decimal assumes that you can identify a stable structure.
This is not my case, I regularly finish and start working on new stuff.
Johnny Decimal was starting to stand in the way of my mind.
For me it was more important to be able to get stuff in and out the system easily, which is difficult if I try to fit it in a previous structure of my mind, which was different and had different priorities.

Johnny includes the reccomendation of reproducing structure for each project, but that kinda defeats purpose

10 folders limiting

## Merging PARA with Johnny Decimal

I learned about PARA

like focus on action

> PARA isn’t a filing system ; it’s a production system .


Combined best of both for me

## Conclusion

I wrote a spec, it's on GitHub (link).
