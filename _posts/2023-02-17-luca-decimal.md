TLDR: If Johnny Decimal didn't work for you, try [my approach](link to spec on GitHub)

I used Johnny Decimal
no way to archive

useful for groups for shared structure, not my thing

many different things in my head/life, not single project

want possibility to add stuff without thinking

Johnny decimal assumes that you can identify a stable structure.
This is not my case, I regularly finish and start working on new stuff.
Johnny Decimal was starting to stand in the way of my mind.
For me it was more important to be able to get stuff in and out the system easily, which is difficult if I try to fit it in a previous structure of my mind, which was different and had different priorities.

Johnny includes the reccomendation of reproducing structure for each project, but that kinda defeats purpose

10 folders limiting



I learned about PARA

like focus on action

> PARA isn’t a filing system ; it’s a production system .


Combined best of both for me
