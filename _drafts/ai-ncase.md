Title? AI safety matters because humanity matters.

TL, DR: Nicky Case [explains well](https://aisafety.dance) why you should care about AI safety.

- Nicky Case recently released the last part of her AI safety series.
- I enjoyed how it was structured.
- AI safety is both a human and technological problem.
    - https://aisafety.dance/media/p3/intro/breakdown.png
    - Humans need to agree on what they want in general.
        - Use of any tool, including AI, is in function of that.
    - https://aisafety.dance/media/p3/SUM.png
    - The technological problem of ensuring the AI does what we want depends on that.

AI Safety used to be a theoretical exercise about the control problem for potential Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)[^nbostrom-superintelligence].
The rise of LLMs turned AI safety in a current concern[^rmiles-AI-ruined].
Even if humanity never achieves AGI, we can see the potential damage right now.
- TODO tecnologia studio AI su cui Robert Miles ha fatto anche un video in cui la LLM attivamente cerca di ingannare l'utente
- TODO human: Demo (di Palanatir?) per una AI per comando di attacchi militari. Veniva menzionato credo nel video di ordinary things sui droni.

[^nbostrom-superintelligence]: A great book about the AI control problem is [*Superintelligence* by Nick Bostrom (2014)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112?cc=de&lang=en&)

[^rmiles-AI-ruined]: For a very honest take about the change of perspective on AI research, I recommend the Youtube video [*AI Ruined My Year* by Robert Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ziuPUeewK0).

- There is no silver bullet.
    - AI alignment should keep outgroving AI capabilities.
    - It is here and we need to deal with it.

- I like the optimism of the series.
    - The existence of artificial intelligence does not mean we need to give up our human intelligence.
