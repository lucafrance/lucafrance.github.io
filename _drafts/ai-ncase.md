Title? AI safety matters because humanity matters.

TL, DR: Nicky Case [explains well](https://aisafety.dance) why you should care about AI safety.

- I enjoyed how it was structured.
- AI safety is both a human and technological problem.
    - Humans need to agree on what they want in general.
        - Use of any tool, including AI, is in function of that.
    - The technological problem of ensuring the AI does what we want depends on that.
- AI safety used to be a theoretical exercise about the AGI control problem.
    - Nick Bostrom wrote about in 2014 in the book *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies*.
- With the rise of LLM it is no longer a theoretical exercise.
- We see now ways where AI can be dangerous.
    - TODO studio AI su cui Robert Miles ha fatto anche un video in cui la LLM attivamente cerca di ingannare l'utente
    - TODO Demo (di Palanatir?) per una AI per comando di attacchi militari. Veniva menzionato credo nel video di ordinary things sui droni.
- There is no silver bullet.
    - AI alignment should keep outgroving AI capabilities.
    - It is here and we need to deal with it.
- I like the optimism of the series.
    - The existence of artificial intelligence does not mean we need to give up our human intelligence.




Nicky Case recently released the last part of her AI safety series.

It is a great introduction to the control problem of AGI.
With advance of LLM is less abstract topic.
We see LLM starting deceiving in ways that were theorised in the past.
TODO example

As mentioned by Robert Miles, now is the time to act.

As capabilities increase, so should alignment techniques.
