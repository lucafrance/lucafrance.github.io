[Ploum (Lionel Dricot)](https://ploum.net) makes [a good case](https://ploum.net/2026-01-22-why-no-european-google.html) for pushing open source culture in Europe.

> We don’t want a European Google Maps! We want our institutions at all levels to contribute to OpenStreetMap (which was created by a British citizen, by the way).

You don't fix the over-dependence on tech giants by creating new tech giants to depend on.
Citizens can only be free if they are not forced to trust any organization or individual they don't want to.

An open source tech stack enables an equal playing field where everybody can thrive.
There can still be proprietary software, as long as true freedom of choice is guaranteed.
For example, you don't need to see the source code of:
- **Your office suite** As long your documents are stored in an open format, you can open them with any program you want.
- **Your email service provider** You can easily migrate to another one, because the email exchange standards are decentralised.
- **Your note-taking app** Thanks to the GDPR [you can export your data in a portable format](https://gdpr.eu/article-20-right-to-data-portability) and migrate it somewhere else.

As the European Union moves away from US-centric tech infrastructure, it is fundamental to prioritise open technologies.
[OpenDesk](https://www.opendesk.eu) is a great example to follow.
The next German government might entshittify the enterprise edition, but you will be forever free to run the community edition wherever you want.

I am glad to see that digital sovereignty is [becoming a political priority in the European Union](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-opens-call-evidence-open-source-digital-ecosystems).

> We often hear that Europeans don’t have, like Americans, the "success culture." Those examples, and there are many more, prove the opposite. Europeans like success. But they often don’t consider "winning against the whole society" as one. Instead, they tend to consider success a collective endeavour. Success is when your work is recognized long after you are gone, when it benefits every citizen. Europeans dream big: they hope that their work will benefit humankind as a whole!
